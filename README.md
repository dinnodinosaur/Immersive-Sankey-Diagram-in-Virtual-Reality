VR Sankey Diagram System
Welcome to the repository for the VR Sankey Diagram System used in User Study 2. This system is designed to allow users to interact with and explore Sankey diagrams in a virtual reality environment, providing a unique perspective on complex data visualization.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) (Version 2020.3.0f1 or later recommended)
- A VR headset compatible with Unity (e.g., Oculus quest3)

Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Unity and select `Open Project`.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open it.
4. Unity might take some time to import all assets and dependencies.

Running the System
Once the project is open in Unity:
1. Navigate to `Assets->Scenes` in the Project pane.
2. You will find three scenes included:
- `tutorial`: A tutorial scene for users to get acquainted with the system before the experiment.
- `exp1`: The scene containing the energy dataset for the experiment.
- `exp2`: The scene containing the finance dataset for the experiment.
To run a scene:
1. Double-click on the scene file you wish to open.
2. Click the `Play` button in Unity to start the scene.
Using the VR System
Ensure your VR headset is properly set up and recognized by Unity. Once you start a scene, you will be able to interact with the Sankey diagram using VR controllers.
